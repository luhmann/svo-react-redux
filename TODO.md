# TODO

Purpose: Document everything left half-finished the last time you had the chance working on this project

## General
* Reconsider use of immutable as it blows up bundle size
* Once finished migrate to webpack2
* Yrsa is included from Google Webfonts currently, reconsider
* Integrate scaler or mocks of it into project, so it runs standalone
* Replace apimocker with dyson

## Styled Components
* Generalize Dessert, Wine, etc.

## Jest

* Consider moving configuration from package.json to a config file
* Reconsider if snapshot testing for storybook is best situated in `app/config`

## Scaler
* Recover from error without exiting
